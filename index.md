# Projects

## OpenGL & SDL2 Wrapper

GUI library which i'm currently working on. I wanted to learn more about OpenGL and also create a foundation on which I'm able to start new projects faster. (I like building as much from scratch as possible.) [Open repository](https://github.com/bertalanaron/3d-graphics)

`c++` `SDL2` `OpenGL` `ImGUI`

## Fractal Visualizer

My chosen assignment for "Training Project Laboratory". With this assignment I was introduced to CUDA and parallel computing. As a side note, it was also interesting for me because I was always fascinated with the beauty of fractals. [Open repository](https://github.com/bertalanaron/gpgpu)

`c++` `CUDA` `SDL2` `ImGUI`

## Falling Sand Automata

This school project is an implementation of one of the most famous cellular automata. I was mainly interested in optimizing the automaton as much as my time and abilities permitted. [Open repository](https://github.com/bertalanaron/cellular-automata)

`c++` `SDL2` `OpenGL` `ImGUI`

## 2D Platformer Clone

A project I chose as my first semester homework. It was my first time working with C or any lower leven language so it was quite challenging, but I really enjoyed working on it and learned a lot in the process. [Open repository](https://github.com/bertalanaron/prog1_nhz)

`c` `SDL2`
