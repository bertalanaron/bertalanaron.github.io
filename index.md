# Projects

- [OpenGL & SDL2 Wrapper](https://github.com/bertalanaron/3d-graphics)
    
    GUI library which i'm currently working on. I wanted to learn more about OpenGL and also create a foundation on which I'm able to start new projects faster. (I like building as much from scratch as possible.)

- [Fractal Visualizer](https://github.com/bertalanaron/gpgpu)
    
    My chosen assignment for "Training Project Laboratory". With this assignment I was introduced to CUDA and parallel computing. As a side note, it was also interesting for me because I was always fascinated with the beauty of fractals. 

- [Falling Sand Automata](https://github.com/bertalanaron/cellular-automata)
    
    This school project is an implementation of one of the most famous cellular automata. I was mainly interested in optimizing the automaton as much as my time and abilities permitted. 

- [2D Platformer Clone](https://github.com/bertalanaron/prog1_nhz)
    
    A project I chose as my first semester homework. It was my first time working with C or any lower leven language so it was quite challenging, but I really enjoyed working on it and learned a lot in the process.
